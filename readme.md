After finishing my Node.js and npm courses, Iâ€™m going to learn a technique called module packaging.

I asked ChatGPT, "What's the difference between Webpack and Vite?" because these two are similar, but Vite is more modern.

However, in the end, I still chose to learn Webpack first, since it's the foundation.

After that, Iâ€™ll learn Vite and figure out the difference on my ownâ€”that's much better, I guess.

Letâ€™s go! ðŸš€
